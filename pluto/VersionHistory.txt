PlutoSdr

Ver 1.0.1x	Initial release good control of all RF parameters for both Rx and Tx.
		Some useful tests, but see ToDo.


ToDo:
*) Incomplete testing of PlutoSdr
*) There is the ability to readRx anw writeTx, but not a way to save receievd signals or send recorded signals
   capture() and playback() have been done for RTL device. Open issue is the ''other'' information on the
   device (LO, description etc)
*) No way to load Rx/Tx FIR filters
