PlutoSdr

Ver 1.0.1x	Initial release good control of all RF parameters for both Rx and Tx.
		Some useful tests, but see ToDo.

Ver 1.0.2	Corrections and modifications with inclusion of LGPLv2 license conditions

ToDo:
*) Incomplete testing of PlutoSdr - cannot see how to test code without the device connected
*) There is the ability to readRx and writeTx, but not a way to save received signals or send recorded signals; capture() and playback() have been done for RTL device. Open issue is the ''other'' information on the device (LO, description etc)
*) Limited implementation of rx/tx fir control
